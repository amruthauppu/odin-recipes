        <strong>Marination</strong>
        <li>chicken left to marinate for few hours is important. The longer you marinate the juicy the chicken gets. marinate the chicken for at least 1 to 2 hours upto overnight.</li>
        <strong>INGREDIENTS</strong>
        <li>Lemon juice, baking powder and yogurt added in the chicken makes it so tender and juicy. It breaks down the tough meat and makes it so succulent.</li>
        <strong>FRYING TEMPERATURE</strong>
        <li>when you drop the chicken in hot oil make sure the oil is at a high temperature. This will make sure the outer coating gets sealed. Immediately lower the heat to medium and fry till chicken is cooked completely. This will make sure the chicken is cooked and stays soft.</li>
        <strong>OVER COOKING</strong>
        <li>don't over cook the chicken. Cut the chicken into small pieces. If you use boneless chicken, it will get cooked faster. So keep checking the chicken whether it is cooked.  Don't over fry the chicken.</li>
